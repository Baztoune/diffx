Diffx is an early stage project. Everything might change. All suggestions welcome :)

See the list of [issues](https://github.com/softwaremill/diffx/issues) and pick one! Or report your own.

If you are having doubts on the why or how something works, don't hesitate to ask a question on [gitter](https://gitter.im/softwaremill/diffx) or via github. This probably means that the documentation, scaladocs or code is unclear and be improved for the benefit of all.
